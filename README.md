This is a zero dependency collection library that is heavily inspired
by [Clojure sequences](https://clojure.org/reference/sequences). Lots of code has been re-used
from [dusankasan/knapsack](https://github.com/DusanKasan/Knapsack) but the overall approach has been to closer integrate
with the native PHP type `iterable`.
